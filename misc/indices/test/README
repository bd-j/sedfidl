28 February 1997. Prepared by Guy Worthey.

This tarfile should contain:

1. The 1997 table of index definitions, including the higher-order Balmers.

2. 8 FITS spectra of IDS stars. The wavelength scale should be tweaked
   via cross-correlation before the index values will match the 
   publishes ones. These spectra are just for purposes of testing 
   program for measuring indices. Note that the header CDELT and CRVAL
   are in units of meters, not Angstroms.

3. A file "mindex.out" which lists the measured index values for the 8 scans, 
   assuming the wavelength calibration in the header is correct.

4. this README


NOTE: The wavelength values for Hgamma and Hdelta are out of date. 
If you use THIS index table on your own data, change the wavelengths to 
those listed in Worthey & Ottaviani 1997, ApJS, 111, 377. However, 
the index values in this tarfile go with the wavelength values listed in
index.table, so everything here is self-consistent.
